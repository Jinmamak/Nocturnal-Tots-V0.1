# Nocturnal Tots (Godot Visual Novel Hybrid

**Version:** 0.1 (Prototype Build)

Nocturnal Tots is a narrative-driven visual novel by day and a surreal multi-genre gameplay experience by night.
Players follow the story of a 9-year-old boy Seb and his three close friends, Marcus, Olivia and Sophia each secretly dealing with personal family struggles.
During the day, the player navigates conversations and choices; at night, dreams transform into unique gameplay segments:

* Rhythm game
* \[Third genre: TBD]

Each dream segment ends with a cutscene revealing subtle hints about a friend’s hidden problem, gradually unfolding the deeper narrative.
